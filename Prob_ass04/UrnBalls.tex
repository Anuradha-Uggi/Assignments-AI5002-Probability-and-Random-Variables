\section{QUESTION(Prob-3,8)}
Six balls are drawn successively from an
urn containing 7 red and 9 black balls. Tell
whether or not the trials of drawing balls are
Bernoulli trials when after each draw the ball
drawn is\\
(i) replaced\\
(ii) not replaced in the urn.
\section{SOLUTION}
Properties to be satisfied if a trial needs to be a bernoulli trial:\\ \\
1.Number of trials should be finite.\\
2.each trial should have utcomes of success and failure.\\
3.if P is the success probability then failure probability should be 1-P.\\
4.probability of success should not vary with trial.\\ \\
\textbf{Case(i):Replaced}\\ \\
Number of red balls = 7\\
Number of black balls = 9\\
let X be the random variable that indicates probability of success and failure.\\ \\
let
\begin{equation*}
    P(x=1)
\end{equation*} is the probability of success lets take it as picking a red ball.\\\\
and 
\begin{equation*}
    P(x=0)
\end{equation*} is the probability of failure lets take it as picking a black ball.\\\\
now lets verify whether in this case the Trials are Bernoulli Trials or not.
Success Probability is given by
\begin{equation*}
    P(x=1) = \frac{7}{16} 
\end{equation*}
 and its same for any red ball drawn since the drawn ball is replaced. so we can state that the Success Probability is remains constant over all Trials.\\and corresponding Failure Probability is
 \begin{equation*}
     P(x=0) = \frac{9}{16} = 1-P(x=1)
 \end{equation*}
 which is also constant for all Trials.now we can claim that
 as it satisfies all properties of Bernoulli therefore Trials under Replaced case are Bernoulli Trials.\\ \\
\textbf{Case(ii):Not Replaced} \\ \\
Now lets check all Satisfactory Criteria of Bernoulli Trials.In this case Success Probability is given by
\begin{equation*}
    P(x=1) =\frac{7}{16}
\end{equation*}
 and similarly for Second Trial the probability of  drawing a red ball from the urn consisting Initial Number of balls less one which is already drawn is
 \begin{equation*}
     P(x=1) = \frac{6}{15} 
 \end{equation*} 
 Corresponding Failure Probabilities are 
 \begin{equation*}
     P(x=0) = \frac{9}{16}
 \end{equation*} and for 2nd trial 
 \begin{equation*}
     P(x=0) = \frac{8}{15}
 \end{equation*}  
 From above observations we can state that  the probability of success and corresponding failure is varying in each trial therefore under Not Replaced case Trials are not Bernoulli Trials. 
\section{CONCLUSION}
Case(i):Drawn balls are Replaced into the Urn here
Trials are Bernoulli Trials \\ \\
Case(ii):Drawn balls are not Replaced into the Urn and here 
Trials are not Bernoulli Trials.
